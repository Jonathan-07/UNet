4th year MPhys reserch project
“Adapting the UNet Neural Network for Generation of Superresolution Biological Images”

I developed a machine learning tool for upscaling the resolution of biological images, thereby developing a less damaging and faster method of producing high resolution biological images. The UNet CNN was adapted via changes to model architecture and optimisation, repurposing it from a segmentation classifier to a superresolution model that provided a four-fold increase in resolution to high accuracy. Throughout the project I developed my deep neural network Python coding skills in PyTorch to a level required for academic research – giving me experience in end-to-end implementation of deep CNNs for a desired use specified by a brief.
